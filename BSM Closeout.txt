Title: LM Framework Current State (1/2) | Breakdown by Material & Critical Applications

Introduction:
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Today, I will be presenting the current state of our License Management (LM) framework, focusing on the breakdown by material and critical applications."

Section 1: Material vs. Non-Material Spend
"Let's start by examining our spend from a material versus non-material perspective. As depicted in the first pie chart on the top left:

Our material spend amounts to $10.7 million, which constitutes 8% of the total.
In contrast, the non-material spend is significantly higher at $132.1 million, representing 92% of the total spend."
Section 2: Material vs. Non-Material Count
"Moving on to the count of material versus non-material applications:

We have 23 material applications, accounting for 11% of the total count.
Meanwhile, there are 177 non-material applications, making up 89%."
Section 3: Critical vs. Non-Critical Spend
"Now, let's shift our focus to the critical versus non-critical spend. As shown in the bottom left pie chart:

Critical applications account for $21.5 million, which is 15% of our total spend.
Non-critical applications dominate our spend at $121.8 million, representing 85%."
Section 4: Critical vs. Non-Critical Count
"Finally, looking at the count of critical versus non-critical applications:

We have 120 critical applications, which is 60% of the total count.
Non-critical applications number 80, making up 40%."
Key Metrics:
"To summarize some key metrics highlighted on the right side of the slide:

Our total software spend amounts to $142 million.
We engage with over 200 software vendors.
Specifically, $98 million is spent on EDFW.
And $32 million is allocated to Softchoice."
Conclusion:
"In conclusion, this breakdown provides a clear view of how our resources are allocated across material and non-material as well as critical and non-critical applications. It highlights areas where we might optimize our spend and vendor management strategies."

Closing:
"Thank you for your attention. I will now take any questions you may have regarding this data."

This script provides a structured approach to explaining the slide's data, ensuring that the audience clearly understands the breakdown of material and critical applications in the LM framework.

ILMT: 100% compliance, 0 over deployments, 53 under deployments (total tracked: 53).
Mainframe: 83% compliance, 1 over deployment, 5 under deployments (total tracked: 6)."
Section 2: 2024 Q1
"Now, let's compare this with Q1 2024:

Microsoft Applications with Discrepancies:

Desktop: Maintained at 86% compliance.

Server: Maintained at 83% compliance.
IBM Applications with Discrepancies:

ILMT: Slight drop to 98% compliance.
Mainframe: Maintained at 83% compliance."
Conclusion:
"By comparing these two periods, we observe consistency in compliance rates for Microsoft, Adobe, and IBM Mainframe applications. Oracle desktop applications improved significantly, while IBM ILMT showed a slight decrease. This information is crucial for addressing discrepancies and improving overall compliance."
