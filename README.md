# How to use Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics

## Overview
This Read Me and its accompanying Jupyter Notebook provides instructions, code, and sample text to walk you through basic machine learning text analysis using Azure Cognitive Services. Specifically, the Jupyter Notebook will show you how to extract key phrases and entities, such as people, locations, and organizations, from a series of lengthy text documents. 

The notebook provides context about the Cognitive Services Python SDK and troubleshooting information so you can take what you've learned and apply it to your own needs! 

* Read Time: 10 min
* Build Time: 20 - 30 min

**Why is this helpful?** 

Doing this kind of text analysis can reduce time and energy required to understand long, open-form text. It can also highlight trends that might otherwise be overlooked. 

**Possible applications**
* Open-form survey responses (what this notebook was originally designed for)
* Customer reviews
* Social media comment analysis 

### Cost Overview
Cognitive Services Text Analytics offers a free tier that include up to 5000 tansactions per month. However, using virtual machines (VMs) can incur signifcant costs (between $50 and $75 per month). 

To keep the cost of this example as low as possible, we'll run the Cognitive Services client and all of our code locally using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and the Python extension. 

To avoid any surprise costs in the future, when you're done with analysis, remember to **delete the resource group.**

### What's in the repo:
* text-analytics-notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that contains explanatory text and code blocks that will walk you through setting up and using Azure Cognitive Services
* TextFiles folder: Sample text files for you to run
* Images: Screenshots and other supporting images for the Jupyter notebook.

## Prior Knowledge
This tutorial assumes you have some knowledge of VS Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks. New to these things? No problem! Check out the resources below:

## Setting up Azure Cognitive Services
If you're new to Cognitive Services, here's what you'll need to do to get set up.
You will need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you do not already have one, set up a Microsoft Azure subscription. You can sign up for a free trial at: https://azure.microsoft.com/free 

## Step 1: Set up an Azure Text Analytics resource
If you don't already have one, use the following steps to create a Cognitive Services resource in your Azure subscription:

1. In another browser tab, open the Azure portal at: https://portal.azure.com
1. Click the **ï¼‹Create a resource button**, search for Text Analytics, and create a Cognitive Services resource with the following settings:
    * Name: Enter a unique name.
    * Subscription: Your Azure subscription.
    * Location: Any available location.
    * Pricing tier: Free F0
    * Resource group: Create a resource group with a unique name.

1. Deployment will take a few minutes, but that's okay! We won't need it just yet. Onward to the next step!

## Step 2: Open the text-analytics-walkthrough notebook in VS Code and run through the code blocks!

1. Open the *text-analytics-notebook.ipynb* notebook in the **text-analytics-walkthrough** folder. 
1. Read through the notebook and run the code blocks as you go.

## Aside: Tracking expenses and setting a budget

1.  Go to your Azure Portal home page
2. Selecting the **Resources Group** for this service.
3. In the new window, select the **"Cost analysis"** section (under "Cost management" on the left-hand side). 
There you can see a cost breakdown of each service as well as forecasted costs.
4. You can also set a budget by clicking on the "Budget" drop-down and selecting "Create a new budget". 

    *Note that this will send you an e-mail alert when you are close to your budget limit, it **will not stop the services.***
